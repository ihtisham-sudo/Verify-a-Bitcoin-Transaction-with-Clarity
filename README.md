# Verify-a-Bitcoin-Transaction-with-Clarity
the Clarity contract is defined within the my-contract namespace. It includes the necessary functions to check the existence of a Bitcoin transaction (bitcoin-tx-exists?) and parse a Bitcoin transaction (parse-tx).
The mint-nft function is the entry point for minting an NFT based on specific Bitcoin transaction conditions. It calls the bitcoin-tx-exists? function to verify if the specified transaction exists. If it does, it calls the check-condition function to verify the specified conditions within the Bitcoin transaction inputs and outputs. If the conditions are met, it proceeds to call the mint-nft-function to perform the NFT minting logic.

The check-condition function iterates over the transaction outputs and checks if there is an output with the specified recipient address and amount. If such an output is found, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The mint-nft-function assumes the existence of an NFT contract with a mint function that requires the owner and metadata as arguments. It retrieves the sender's address using get-sender, assigns it to the nft-owner variable, and defines the desired metadata for the NFT in the nft-metadata variable. It then calls the mint function of the NFT contract, passing the owner and metadata as arguments using call-contract.

Remember to replace "ST12345678901234567890AAAAAAAAAAAAAA.nft-contract" with the actual contract address and "mint" with the appropriate function name in your NFT contract.
